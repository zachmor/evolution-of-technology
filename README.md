# Evolution of Technology

Understanding the history of technological adaptation is important to understand the current state of technology. This project aims to categorize technology into identifying attriibutes that can be used to construct a phylogeny and establish lines of descent.

## Attributes

Multiple techniques are used to generate attributes: one is inspired from a lecture given by [Matthew Fuxjager](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mfuxjage) on biological communication efficacy and efficiency; two is a binary flag for each human sense; and finally, a list of attributes is generated by choosing a characteristic that was unique when the technology came out.

## Images

The images here are visualizations of t-SNE being run on different subsets of attributes.
